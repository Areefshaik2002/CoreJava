	/* Big O Notation
	 * 
	 * O(1) - Constant
	 * Algorithm that takes same amount(very less) of time for any number
	 * of steps or any amount of data
	 * Ex:1.Random access of element in an array
	 * 	  2.Inserting an element at the beginning of a LinkedList.	
	 * 
	 * O(n)  - Linear
	 * Algorithm that takes more time as data increases. 
	 * Ex: 1.Searching through a linkedList.
	 *     2.for loop - time increases as the number of steps to be iterated increases.
	 *     
	 * O(log n) - Logarithmic time
	 * Algorithm takes large time at the beginning but as data increases it takes less time.
	 * Ex:binary search
	 * 
	 * O(n log n) - quasilinear time
	 * Algorithm takes less time at the beginning but as data increases it take large time.
	 * Ex:Quick sort, merge sort, heap sort.
	 * 
	 * O(n^2) - Quadratic time
	 * Algorithm takes takes large time.
	 * insertion sort, selection sort, bubble sort.
	 * 
	 * O(n!) - Factorial time.
	 * Algorithm takes very very large time(very very slow).
	 * Ex:Traveling salesman problem.
